It didn?t matter that he did the crime or that she wished he was dead. Winter thought he?d cool off in jail and be anything but the horror he was, or that at the very least she?d have time to disappear before he got out.But she was wrong. Three years came and went too fast, and prison only gave him time to plan. And while Winter anticipated his vengeance, she didn?t expect this. He doesn?t want to make her hurt. He wants to make everything hurt.Damon knows he needs to get rid of Winter?s father, giving her, her sister, and her mother nowhere to run. The Ashby women are desperate for a knight in shining armor. But that?s not what?s coming.It's time Damon took control of his future. It?s time he showed them all that he will never stop being the nightmare </p>
